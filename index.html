                <img src="./images/IMG_3714.JPEG">

                <p>My name is Nicholas Kidder, I am 24 years old. I have lived in Orange County, California my entire
                    life.
                    Currently, I work in a fabrication shop as welder but I discovered web/software development about a
                    year
                    ago
                    and
                    decided that that was the career I desired. I recently started going back to college as a computer
                    science major and my goal is to transfer from the junior college that I am curently at to UCI to
                    recive
                    my
                    degree.
                    Some of
                    my
                    hobbies include, going to the gym, hiking, cooking, spending time with my family, my girlfriend, and
                    my
                    friends,
                    and of course always trying to further my education and knowledge of new skills.</p>
                <p>One major aspect that attracted
                    me to web development and the tech field in general is the fact that it's always growing and
                    evolving so
                    there
                    will always be new skills and tools to learn. I love the satisfaction and the sense of pride that
                    come
                    when
                    a
                    line of code works and when it doesn't work, it may sound crazy, but I even love going back and
                    looking
                    for
                    bugs
                    in my code. I love problem solving, when I approach a problem or a bug in the code I like to look at
                    it
                    like
                    a
                    puzzle where every piece has to fit perfectly in order for it to work and come out the way you want.
